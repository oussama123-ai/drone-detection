# Overview :

Drone Capability & The Importance of a Drone Detection System at Public Events

It seems like the more advanced technology gets, the smaller things become. From slimmer cell phones to handheld computers and tiny cameras, it’s becoming much easier to carry devices into any building. And while these technological advances provide amazing access to information and entertainment, they also create some major security issues. Particularly, when it comes to drones.

While no one likes talking (or thinking) about potential threats at public events, it’s important to understand that new advances in drone capability and technology put more people at risk. Luckily, there are ways to curb these risks and amp up security so that concert goers, football fans and more can feel safe at any large public event.

The solution? A drone detection system.

# Installing :

conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate Drone_detection

pip install requirment.txt

# Models :

we've used thre models and each one is better than the rest

path : 

../Models/
  GNB.pkl
  
  Kneighbors.pkl
  
  SVC.pkl
  
# Datasets : 
 you can try with the file like IQ.csv 
 all the data used have same form like this file 
#  Getting predictions :
just you need now to activate your env drone_detection with terminal in the folder specified create
